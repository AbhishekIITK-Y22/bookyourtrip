## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "missing token" Error

**Problem**: You're not authenticated.

**Solution**: 
1. Login using `POST /auth/login`
2. Copy the token from the response
3. Include it in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`

#### 2. "seat temporarily held" Error

**Problem**: Someone else is currently booking that seat.

**Solution**: 
- Wait 2 minutes and try again
- Or select a different seat

#### 3. "seat already taken" Error

**Problem**: The seat has been permanently booked.

**Solution**: Select a different seat

#### 4. "already paid" Error

**Problem**: You're trying to pay for a booking twice.

**Solution**: Check your booking status using `GET /bookings/:id`

#### 5. Payment Failure

**Problem**: Payment was declined.

**Solution**: 
- Check your card details
- For testing, ensure card doesn't start with `0000`
- Try a different payment method

#### 6. "forbidden" Error

**Problem**: You're trying to access/modify a resource you don't own.

**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're logged in with the correct account

## Best Practices

### For Customers

1. **Book Early**: Prices may increase closer to departure due to dynamic pricing
2. **Use Idempotency Keys**: Prevent accidental duplicate bookings
3. **Provide Accurate Details**: Double-check passenger information before payment
4. **Cancel Early**: Avoid penalties by canceling/rescheduling >24 hours before departure

### For Providers

1. **Keep Information Updated**: Regularly update company contact details
2. **Monitor Capacity**: Don't oversell trips
3. **Set Competitive Pricing**: Use dynamic pricing insights from AI service
4. **Update Status**: Disable service during maintenance periods

### Security

1. **Never Share Tokens**: Keep your JWT tokens private
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Minimum 8 characters with mix of letters, numbers, symbols
3. **Logout After Use**: Tokens expire after 2 hours
4. **Monitor Bookings**: Regularly check for unauthorized activity
