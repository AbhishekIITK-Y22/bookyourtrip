**User Prompt**:
```
"But now the tsconfig.json files itself are showing linter errors"
```

**Problem**:
- `rootDir: "src"` conflicted with test files in `tests/`
- Type definitions not found in monorepo setup

**AI Solution**:
1. Changed `rootDir: "."` to include both src and tests
2. Added `typeRoots` for monorepo type resolution
3. Updated `include` array to cover test files
4. Added proper `types: ["node", "jest"]`

**Files Modified**:
- `services/*/tsconfig.json` (all 3 services)
